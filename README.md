# TopDownGame

I made this "game" as a way to put into practice some of the OOP design patterns that I learned about while reading [Dive Into Design Patterns](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/book). This is made in Unity and in the C# language
so I made an effort to avoid coupling AT ALL COSTS! These patterns manifest themselves as components attached to each GameObject rather than one player class or enemy type - A player has a healthbar, a spellbook, etc.
